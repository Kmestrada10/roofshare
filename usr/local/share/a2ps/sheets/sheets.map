#
# This file defines the rules used by a2ps to select a style sheet
# when pretty-printing a file.  It is read from bottom-up, so that
# the last successful rule is considered.
#
# The format of each line is:
#
# <pattern> <language key>
#	In which case the path/filename is matched against the pattern
#	This helps for special paths, but if you want to match, say,
#	Makefiles, don't forget `*' so that src/Makefile matches.
#
# ** <pattern> <language key>
#	In which case the result of a call to file(1) upon the
#	file is matched against the pattern
#
# *** <path>
#	In which case a sheets.map is included at this point.
#	This may be the case if you define a personal extension
#	of the system's sheets.map
#
# The special language "binary" makes a2ps ignore the file unless
# --print-anyway is given.

# Note that <language key> is _not_ the nice looking name of the
# language (e.g., C++, or Common Lisp), but the portable prefix part
# of the ssh file name (e.g., cpp, or clisp)
